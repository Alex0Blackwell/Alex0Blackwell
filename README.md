I am a second-year computing science student at Simon Fraser University. I use GitHub mainly as version control for developing and displaying personal projects as well as miscellaneous code I write. My interests include operating systems and machine learning. I hope to start some new projects involving these subjects soon after taking some relevant university courses this spring.
