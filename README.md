<h2 align ="center"> Hello ðŸ‘‹ </h2>

I am a third-year computing science student at Simon Fraser University (SFU). Every term I have been on the Dean or President's Honour Roll and been awarded the Simon Fraser Open Scholarship for academic achievement.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In both university clubs and my free time, competitive programming serves as a hobby. In university I earned second place in the university coding competition; further, I represented SFU on a team of three members for the Pacific Northwest Regional Programming Contest where we achieved a top 10 placement in Canada. Outside of university, I participated in Google Kickstart coding competitions where I placed top 35 in Canada.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My upper-division courses reflect my interests with a concentration on A.I. and information systems. I was involved in a mentorship with [Borealis AI](https://www.borealisai.com/en/) where our team evaluated different machine learning models for time-series prediction to determine future water consumption in New York.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I completed an internship at [Demonware](https://www.demonware.net/) contributing to the digital marketplace of Activision franchises such as Call of Duty. The internship extended to a position as a Junior Software Engineer where I work part-time while going to school full-time; moreover, outside of work, I continue to build new projects as developing projects is among my favourite hobbies.
